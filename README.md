Cookie Clicker - Weekend Assignment #2
Madi Webb

(10/2/22)
When I initially forked the starting point given in the assignment workshop, I guess I made the repo private without thinking much about it.
However when I tried to make it public to turn it in; it says "For security reasons, you cannot change the visibility of a fork."
I had to make a new repo and copy everything over, that's why this repo only has one commit.
I got a little confused doing this so I hope nothing got messed up.
